Data Description for ygocardsbase.csv:

NB This csv contains the master dataset created from the data collected via the API at https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/ , the features described here naturally will be relevant to all further dataframes created from this original.

Features:

name - the name of the individual card (these are quasi unique to each card with the only overlap being due to reprints of a card, however this master dataset does not currently separate cards by each printing)

kind - The category of card that the card belongs to, broadly speaking cards belong to 3 main types(that can be further sub-divided):
    
    1.monsters - all cards with kind not spell or trap belong to a subcategory of monster (the two main ones being effect and normal)

level - every monster except link monsters has a level between 0 and 13 (technically xyz have ranks rather than levels but for the purposes of this project it is fine to equate level to rank)

card_text - the text printed on each card whether it is a description of the card or its effects

effect_or_flavour_text - a binary indicator of whether the card_text describes an effect (1) or is just flavour text (0) (NB 0s are almost exclusively normal monsters)

attack - the attack value printed on each monster card, for spells and traps it is recorded as None (NB for any card with a non-numeric attack e.g. ?, x000 the attack is recorded as 0)

defence - the defence value printed on each monster card except link monsters, for spells and traps it is recorded as None

pendulum_scale - a unique element exclusive to pendulum monsters, not useful for this project but kept for completeness in this dataset

link_rating - a unique element exclusive to link monsters, not useful for this project but kept for completeness in this dataset

link_markers - a unique element exclusive to link monsters, not useful for this project but kept for completeness in this dataset

printings - the total number times the card has been printed

sets - a list of the sets in which the card has been printed

set_codes - a list of the unique identifying codes for the card corresponding to the sets it has been printed in

set_rarities - a list of the rarities of the card's printings corresponding with each set code

rarity_codes - the codes for the rarities in the corresponding set rarities entry

total_views - the total number of times that the card's page has been viewed in the database at https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/

views_past_week - the number of times that the card's page has been viewed in the database at https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/ in the past week (this data was retrieved 01/02/2022)

lowest_price - the data retrieved via the API contains the lowest prices it can retrieve from several vendors for each card, this value is the lowest price retrieved by the API from tcgplayer and is the basic target variable (until the advanced pricing data is retrieved directly from tcgplayer's own API)

release_date - the date the card was released into the TCG (the western side of the card game as cards are often released earlier in Asia (referred to as the OCG))

staple - a binary indicator of whether the card is considered a staple (very playable in the actual game) by the community behind the API
    0 - non-staple
    1 - staple

ban_status - an indicator of the card's current playability in the actual game (TCG banlist)
    0 - the card is banned and not allowed in any competitive deck
    1 - the card is limited and only 1 copy of it is allowed in any competitive deck
    2 - the card is semi-limited and only 2 copies of it are allowed in any competitive deck
    3 - the card is unlimited, the maximum 3 copies are playable
