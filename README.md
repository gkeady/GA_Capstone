# Predicting Trading Card Prices
## Introduction
Over the course of the pandemic crafts and hobbies saw an increase in popularity as many people stuck at home looked back fondly on their childhood pastimes. Now armed with greater financial fire power new and returning enthusiasts have altered the market for collectibles such as trading cards.
The initial aim of this project was to build a model for predicting trading card prices across multiple TCGs (trading card games) however it ended up being more effective to stick to just one, Yu-Gi-Oh!. The intention was that the model (if good enough) could be used to predict the more valueable cards in a newly released set, information which could then be used by buyers and collectors to work out what to buy.
